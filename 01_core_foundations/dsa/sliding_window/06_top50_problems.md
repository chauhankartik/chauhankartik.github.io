Week 3 (Days 4-5):  Phase 7 — Advanced (#38-#50)
```

### How to Practice Each Problem

```
1. Read the problem. Classify it (fixed/variable/counting/deque).
2. Write the brute force approach and its complexity.
3. Apply the correct template from 00_theory.md.
4. Code the optimal solution WITHOUT looking at hints.
5. Verify: Can you explain why it's O(n) in one sentence?
6. Do the follow-ups. They build deeper intuition.
```

## Quick Pattern Checklist (Before Coding)

- [ ] Is this about **contiguous** subarrays/substrings?
- [ ] Is the window **fixed** or **variable** size?
- [ ] Am I looking for **longest**, **shortest**, or **count**?
- [ ] Is the constraint **monotonic** (sum with positives, distinct count)?
- [ ] Does it involve **exactly K**? → Use atMost decomposition
- [ ] Do I need **window max/min**? → Monotonic deque
- [ ] Are there **negative numbers** in a sum problem? → Prefix sum + deque, NOT basic window
