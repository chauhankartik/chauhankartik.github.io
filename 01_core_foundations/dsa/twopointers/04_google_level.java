     * Problem: Given string s of ']' and '[' of even length n (equal counts).
     * In one swap, choose any two characters and swap them.
     * Return the minimum swaps to make s balanced.
     *
     * Key observation:
     * A string with k mismatched pairs of brackets (unmatched ']' + '[')
     * requires ⌈k/2⌉ swaps (each swap fixes 2 mismatched pairs).
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Use two pointers: left scans right, right scans left.
     * 2. left finds an unmatched ']' (too many closing brackets).
     * 3. right finds an unmatched '[' (opening bracket after closing).
     * 4. Swap → fixes one pair of mismatches at left, one at right.
     *    Each such swap reduces mismatches by 2.
     *
     * Simpler mathematical derivation:
     * - Scan left to right, count open brackets.
     * - When count goes negative → unmatched ']' found.
     * - Count mismatched = max negative depth reached.
     * - Swaps = ⌈mismatched / 2⌉.

     *
     * Follow-up 2: What if the equal count guarantee is removed?
     *   → First check if balance == 0 (total '[' == total ']'). If not, impossible.
     *
     * Follow-up 3: Prove ⌈k/2⌉ swaps is optimal:
     *   → Each swap can fix AT MOST 2 mismatched brackets (one ']' and one '[').
     *   → If there are k mismatches, we need at least k/2 swaps → lower bound ⌈k/2⌉.
